vide - Vim as an IDE.
=====================

Repository that provides a vimrc file and associated plugins to give an IDE
of sorts for the vim editor.

By centralising the repository it should make seting up an envionment quick
and easy. If you'd like to add any new plugins favor cross platform plugins
(vim script based) over those which require compilation.

Installation
============
- Clone the repository and copy the .vimrc file and .vim folder into your
home directory.
